<h1 align="center"> TheInternetProject </h1>

Step by step to creating test project. I used GitHub repositories and actions to do a continouus integration.
My project was based on this website: https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/

- I created a folder and push to Github create a new repository on the command line:

- [X] echo "# TheInternetProject" >> README.md
- [X] git init
- [X] git add README.md
- [X] git commit -m "first commit"
- [X] git branch -M main
- [X] git remote add origin https://github.com/anacosantos/TheInternetProject.git
- [X] git push -u origin main

:trophy: GitHub repository created :heavy_check_mark:
